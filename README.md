# LearnReactNative

My Style of Learning [React-Native](https://reactnative.dev/) while Coding by making this app, that demonstrates a PoC of various components and functionality in Mobile Apps, from buttons to fetching data from server.

This Project has been made using [expo.io](https://expo.io/)
I have mainly tested this App on an Android device, and would be later testing the same on
an iOS simulator.

** This Project is currently a Work-in-Progress **

## Installation

Please Clone or Fork this Repository and run the following command to install node_modules

```bash
yarn install 
```
Run the App using either of the following commands, depending upon your OS.

```
yarn start
yarn android   # Scan QR on your android device after installing expo app 
yarn ios
```
