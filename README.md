# LearnReactNative

My Style of Learning [React-Native](https://reactnative.dev/) while Coding by making this app, that demonstrates a PoC of various components and functionality in Mobile Apps, from buttons to fetching data from server.

This Project has been made using [expo.io](https://expo.io/).
I have mainly tested this App on an Android device, and would be later testing the same on
an iOS simulator.

#### **__The Project is currently a Work-in-Progress__**

## Installation

Please Clone or Fork this Repository and run the following command to install 'node_modules'
